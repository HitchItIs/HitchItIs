# Hi, I'm Can 👋 

### From the kitchen to the codebase. 🛠️💻

I’m a **Junior Python Developer (Trainee)** currently retraining at GFN. I bring a high-pressure work ethic from professional kitchens and sales to software engineering. I don't look for excuses; I look for solutions.

### 🚀 What I'm working on
- **Backend Security:** Developing a [Password Leak Checker](https://github.com/HitchItIs/Password-Leak-Checker) based on K-Anonymity principles.
- **Network Reconnaissance:** Building a [Subdomain Scanner](https://github.com/HitchItIs/Subdomain-Scanner) to automate DNS infrastructure analysis.
